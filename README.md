## Topic: Fractional cascading

- In this paper, we investigate the ```Fractional Cascading``` technique which is used in building range trees and for fast searching of an element in multiple arrays.  
- In this venture, we introduce and examine ```Linear Search```, ```Binary Search```, ```Bridge Building``` and ```Fractional Cascading```.  
- We also look at some of the ```applications``` of this technique, and give a video demonstration of its capabilities.
